# Grand Tournament Chess

By Lucien Bao. Adapted from Ralph Betza's [Chess with Different Armies](https://www.chessvariants.com/unequal.dir/cwda.html), with additional armies provided by various contributors.

## Overview

Welcome to the *Grand Tournament*, general! Soldiers from around the world have come to compete in most festive martial games, but they need someone to lead them. Choose your army — will you be crowned champion, or get knocked off your high horse?

> **Helpful hint:** this document uses Ralph Betza's [funny notation](https://www.chessvariants.com/d.betza/chessvar/pieces/notation.html) to describe the movement patterns of the various pieces. Some of them might be familiar, but most are fairy (custom) chess pieces you might not have seen before!

## Common pieces

Most armies have the King and Pawns in common with orthodox Chess.

### King

Royally important and royally slow, this is the original King (symbol: K). It can move to the eight squares directly adjacent to it, including diagonals (funny notation: WF). Its fighting piece value is about 3 pawns, although of course it cannot be traded.

The King is the most important piece; when it is attacked (called *check*), its owner must move it out of check, interpose a piece to block the check, or capture/immobilize the threatening piece. When this is not possible, the position is called *checkmate* and the game is lost.

The King has a special move called *castling*. In orthodox chess, this is done with either of the two Rooks sitting on a1 (long, marked O-O-O) and h1 (short, marked O-O). However, there might now be different pieces there, so the rules have a small modification. Normally, castling is the same. But!:

> **Rules note**: when castling long (O-O-O) with a *colorbound* piece — that is, one which is restricted to either the light or dark squares only — the King moves to b1 and the other piece moves to c1 instead of the normal castling destination squares (c1 and d1, respectively).

This is mandatory so that the colorbound piece stays on the same-color square complex. Colorbound pieces will be marked as such in these rules.

### Pawn

Weak but steadfast and numerous, the backbone of your army is made up of Pawns (symbol: *none*). They move one square forward and capture on their forward diagonals (funny notation: mfWcfF).

They have two and a half special abilities (yes, "half"):

1. When a pawn reaches the 8th rank (the farthest row from its owner's perspective), it may promote to any non-King piece from either army present at the start.
2. When a pawn has not yet moved, it may, instead of its normal one-step move, make a double-step move. For example, a white pawn on e2 may move to either e3 or e4.
    1. *En passant*. When a pawn is on its fifth rank and an enemy pawn on an adjacent file makes a double-step move, the first pawn may capture the second as if it had only moved one step. For example, 1. e4 e6 2. e5 d5 3. exd6 e.p. This move ensures that a pawn cannot use its double-step move to evade capture by an enemy pawn.

## Armies

Each army's back rank is described from the outside in, progressing from the a/h files to b/g and c/f, then ending with the Queen's starting square.

### The Fabulous FIDEs

This is the original Chess army you know and love. Nothing is different; in fact, when two Fabulous FIDE armies face off, it's just normal Chess. (So let's not do that, shall we?)

#### The Rook

Strong and reliable but somewhat slow to get in the game, this is the original Rook (symbol: R). It moves orthogonally in all four directions (funny notation: WW or R). Its piece value is about 5 pawns.

#### The Knight

The agile and tricky original Knight (symbol: N). It moves in an L-shape; that is, two squares orthogonally and then one square at a right angle (funny notation: N). It moves by jumping, so it cannot be blocked. Its piece value is about 3 pawns.

#### The Bishop

The original sniper Bishop (symbol: B). It moves along the diagonals (funny notation: FF or B), which makes it a *colorbound* piece. Its piece value is slightly above 3 pawns, even more if both Bishops are had at once.

#### The Queen

Her Majesty the Queen is without a doubt the strongest of the original FIDE fighters (symbol: Q). She has the combined powers of the Rook and Bishop, able to move in all 8 directions (funny notation: RB or Q). Its piece value is about 9 pawns.

### The Colorbound Clobberers

By Ralph Betza ([original article](https://www.chessvariants.com/d.betza/chessvar/cda/colclob.html))

From Betza's original description:

> This is an army with a theme, and the theme is the Bishop.
>
> The Colorbound Clobberers have two kinds of colorbound pieces, that is, two kinds of pieces whose moves are restricted to squares of one color.
>
> In addition, the Clobberers have an unusual material balance: their Queen is notably weaker than the FIDE Queen, and their Bishop (the FAD) is noticeably stronger.

We use the "Colorbound Clobberers II" starting position, as the original position has some notable undefended pawns.

#### The Bede

Pronounced "bee-dee", the Bede is a slightly improved Bishop (symbol: BD). It can move like a Bishop, but also like a Dabbaba — a two-space orthogonal jump (funny notation: BD). Its value is about 5 pawns, comparable to a FIDE Rook. Note that this is a *colorbound* piece. When castling long (O-O-O), the King moves to b1 and the Bede moves to c1 to maintain its color.

#### The FAD

The FAD is versatile if short-ranged piece (symbol: FA). It combines the movement abilities of the Ferz, Alfil, and Dabbaba; that is to say, it may jump one or two spaces diagonally, or exactly two spaces orthogonally (funny notation: FAD). Its value is about 4.5 pawns, somewhere between a FIDE Bishop and Rook. This is a *colorbound* piece.

#### The Waffle

The Waffle is a FAD with fewer moves, but somewhat makes up for it by not being colorbound (symbol: WA). It is a combination Wazir and Alfil, meaning that it can jump exactly two squares diagonally or one square orthogonally (funny notation: WA). Its value is about 3 pawns, comparable to a FIDE Knight.

#### The Cardinal

The Clobberers' version of the Queen is the Cardinal (symbol: CA). The Cardinal can move as either a Knight or Bishop (funny notation: NB). Although it is weaker than a FIDE Queen, it is still solidly within its tier; its value is about about 8 pawns.

### The Nutty Knights

By Ralph Betza ([original article](https://www.chessvariants.com/d.betza/chessvar/dan/nighties.html))

From Betza's original description:

> This team has been recruited from the homeland of the FIDE Knight, a mountainous place where the inhabitants have had to learn to leap from one peak to another.
>
> Not only are all the pieces on the team Knightish, but in many cases they can't go back to where they came from. That is, they are also like the FIDE Pawn in that their forward motion is not the same as their retreating motion.

#### The Charging Rook

The Charging Rook is a strong attacking piece that is slow to retreat (symbol: CR). It can move forwards and sideways like the FIDE Rook, and backwards like the King (funny notation: fhRhbK). Its value is about 5 pawns, comparable to a FIDE Rook.

#### The Fibnif

If you squeezed a FIDE Knight from the sides, you might get something like a Fibnif (symbol: FN). It combines the vertically longest moves of a Knight — that is, those in which it moves two steps forward or backward — with all the moves of a Ferz (funny notation: fbNF or vNF). Although it cannot move sideways as quickly, it is more precise at very short ranges; its value is about 3 pawns, comparable to a FIDE Knight.

#### The Charging Knight

The Charging Knight is a medium-power attacking piece that is slow to retreat (symbol: CN). It has the forward four moves of the FIDE Knight, plus the sideways and backwards moves of the King (funny notation: fhNhbK). Its value is slightly more than 3 pawns, comparable to a FIDE Bishop.

#### The Colonel

The Colonel is a forward-attacking powerhouse that, like many of its teammates, has some trouble looking behind it (symbol: CO). It can move forwards and sideways like a FIDE Rook, has the forward four moves of the Knight, and also has all the moves of a King (funny notation: fhRfhNK). Its value is about 9 pawns, comparable to a FIDE Queen or a Chancellor.

### The Remarkable Rookies

By Ralph Betza ([original article](https://www.chessvariants.com/d.betza/chessvar/dan/rookies.html)).

From Betza's original description:

> We recently sent a scout to check out the prospects from the homeland of the FIDE Rook. ... Rookland is a remarkably rectangular island, with very straight streets, and the pieces that grow up there reflect this in their orthogonal style of play.

#### The Short Rook

The Short Rook is, like its cousin, a straight-line piece, but doesn't quite have the reach (symbol: SR). As the name might suggest, it can only move half as far: orthogonally, up to four squares (funny notation: W4 or R4). Its piece value is about 4 pawns, between a FIDE Bishop and Rook.

#### The Woody Rook

The Woody Rook is a short-ranged leaper (symbol: WR). It moves like a Wazir or Dabbaba; that is, it may jump one or two squares orthogonally (funny notation: WD). Its piece value is slightly below 3 pawns, slightly less than a FIDE Knight.

#### The Half Duck

The Half Duck, like the Woody Rook, is a short-ranged leaper (symbol: HD). It moves as a combination Threeleaper, Ferz, and Dabbaba; that is, one space diagonally or two or three spaces jumping orthogonally (funny notation: HFD). Its piece value is slightly above 5 pawns, slightly greater than a FIDE Rook.

#### The Chancellor

The Chancellor is a more melee-focused Queen variant (symbol: CH). Instead of Rook and Bishop, the Chancellor combines Rook and Knight powers (funny notation: NR). Its Knight moves are jumping moves. Its piece value is about 9 pawns, comparable to a FIDE Queen.
